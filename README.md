How to setup environment

Start GitPod environment by going to http://gitpod.io/#/https://github.com/realvz/UpdateThinSoftware
Install hugo npm install hugo-bin --save-dev
Make changes to the presentation in content/_index.md
Start a new terminal in GitPod and start Hugo server `npx hugo server`

If using GitPod's docker container, you don't need to install Hugo as it comes pre-installed.
