How to setup environment
1. Start GitPod environment by going to http://gitpod.io/#/https://github.com/realvz/UpdateThinSoftware
2. Install hugo npm install hugo-bin --save-dev
3. Make changes to the presentation in content/_index.md
4. Start a new terminal in GitPod and start Hugo server

If using GitPod's custom DockerFile, you don't need to install Hugo. It is already built into the Docker image.
